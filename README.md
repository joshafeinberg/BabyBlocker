# BabyBlocker

This was a little side project requested on Daddit (/r/daddit) that I put together real quick. 

For anyone that has ever had their kid hold the phone while video chatting, the goal of this app is to stop them from being able to click the hang up button. 

It does this by simply providing an overlay when activated so the baby can't click on anything. To remove the block you either click the screen 5 times in 30 seconds or disable it via the notification.

Will eventually get this into the app store but there is a release apk available at https://github.com/joshafeinberg/BabyBlocker/blob/main/app/release/app-release.apk
